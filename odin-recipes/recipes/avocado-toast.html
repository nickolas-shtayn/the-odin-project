        <img src="../images/avocado-toast.jpg">
        <p>This vibrant toast takes classic avocado toast to a whole new level! Creamy avocado gets a fiery kick from homemade chili oil, while a perfectly soft-boiled egg adds a luxurious touch. Fresh microgreens and a sprinkle of sesame seeds bring a burst of flavor and texture in every bite</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slice of high-quality bread (sourdough, whole wheat, or your favorite)</li>
            <li>1/2 ripe avocado</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon homemade chili oil <a href="../recipes/chili-oil.html">(see previous recipe!)</a></li>
            <li>1 soft boiled egg <a href="../recipes/soft-boiled-egg.html">(see previous recipe!)</a></li>
            <li>Pinch of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maldon-Sea-Salt-Flakes-ounce/dp/B00017028M">Maldon flaky salt</a></li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup microgreens (such as pea shoots or sunflower greens)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white and black sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast your bread to your desired level of crispness. You can use a toaster, a pan with a little butter or oil, or a grill.</li>
            <li>While the bread toasts, mash the avocado in a bowl. Season it with a pinch of salt and pepper for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Spread the mashed avocado evenly over the toasted bread. Drizzle with a generous tablespoon of your homemade chili oil, letting it pool a little for a visually stunning presentation.</li>
            <li>Carefully peel your soft-boiled egg and place it on top of the avocado toast. Season the egg with a little more salt and pepper, if desired.</li>
            <li>Garnish your toast with a sprinkle of microgreens for a fresh, vibrant touch.</li>
            <li>Top it all off with sesame seeds for a nutty flavor and a textural contrast.</li>
        </ol>
